Welcome to my profile! I'm just a random human being who feels happy when write code, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Here's a glimpse of cool tech stuff I'm working on at the moment:

- 🔭 I’m continuing to develop complex real-world scenario projects with C++.
- I’m currently learning C++ advanced topics and JUCE Framework.
- 💬 Ask me about C++, Vim, touch typing, keyboards, music, and a bunch of stuff.

## ✨So, what do I do?✨
As a devoted Software Engineer, I craft robust solutions in the realm of C and C++. My toolkit includes spells in C/C++, Vim, and sprinkles of audio technologies magic.
I'm all about pushing the boundaries of my craft. You'll find me on a perpetual adventure of leveling up my skills, so I'm always on the cutting edge of software wizardry. 🎩🔮
I have a proven track record of constantly improving my skills to stay at the forefront of the industry. My professional work experience allows me to create exceptional projects that deliver a seamless user experience. I excel in teamwork and have a quick learning curve, making me an asset to any project and company.
Outside of coding, I deeply love making music and enjoy the science of touch typing. I am also a professional swimmer, demonstrating my commitment and discipline in both the digital and physical realms. 🏊‍♂️💻
