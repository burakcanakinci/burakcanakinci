[My Portfolio](https://burakcanakinci.netlify.app/)

Welcome to my profile! I'm just a random human being who feels happy when writing code. Here's a glimpse of the tech stuff I'm working on at the moment:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m continuing to develop complex, real-world scenario projects with C++.
- Iâ€™m currently gaining more knowledge about C++ advanced topics and the Qt Framework.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, Vim, touch typing, keyboards, music production, audio engineering and a bunch of other things!
