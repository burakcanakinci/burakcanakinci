## Hello there, I'm Burak
[My Portfolio](https://burakcanakinci.netlify.app/)

Welcome to my profile! I'm just a random human being who feels happy when writing code. Here's a glimpse of the tech stuff I'm working on at the moment:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m continuing to develop complex, real-world scenario projects with C++.
- Iâ€™m currently gaining more knowledge about C++ advanced topics and the Qt Framework.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, Vim, touch typing, keyboards, music production, audio engineering and a bunch of other things!

### So, what do I do?
As a devoted Software Engineer, I craft solutions in the realm of C++. My toolkit includes expertise in C++, Vim, Qt, and a touch of audio technology magic.
I'm all about pushing the boundaries of my craft. You'll find me on a perpetual adventure, constantly leveling up my skills to stay on the cutting edge of software wizardry.
My professional experience allows me to create exceptional projects that deliver a seamless user experience. I excel in teamwork and have a quick learning curve, making me an asset to any project or company.
Outside of coding, I have a deep love for making music and enjoy the science of touch typing. I am also a professional swimmer and underwater hockey player, demonstrating my commitment and discipline in both the digital and physical realms.
