Welcome to my profile! I'm just a random nerdy human being who feels happy when write codes, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (yes I spent 4 years at hell but I managed to stay at the top). Here's a glimpse of tech cool stuff I'm working on at the moment:

- 🔭 I’m continuing to develop complex real-world scenario projects with C, and C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C advanced topics and digging deep  into understanding the background concepts for better problem-solving and faster debugging.
-  I'm currently in the exciting process of job hunting, so don't hesitate to reach out – I'd be thrilled to bring some joy to your team!
- 💬 Ask me about C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Angular, Vim, Linux/Unix, OOP, NodeJS, Amazon AWS, Qt, CMake, Objective-C, CANBus - MQTT - RS485, STM32 Microcontroller, System Level Programming, Git/GitHub, and a bunch of stuff (don't ask me).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I cry when I see a fat error in the console and then I usually find the solution when I'm in the shower.

## ✨So, what do I do?✨
As a devoted Software Engineer, I craft robust solutions in the realm of C and C++. My toolkit includes spells in C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and sprinkles of front-end technologies magic.
I'm all about pushing the boundaries of my craft. You'll find me on a perpetual adventure of leveling up my skills, so I'm always on the cutting edge of web wizardry. 🎩🔮
I have a proven track record of constantly improving my skills to stay at the forefront of the industry. My professional work experience in JavaScript and also in E-commerce projects allows me to create exceptional projects that deliver a seamless user experience. I excel in teamwork and have a quick learning curve, making me an asset to any project and company.
