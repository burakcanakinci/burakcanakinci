[My Portfolio](https://burakcanakinci.netlify.app/)

I'm just a random human being who feels happy when writing code. Here's a glimpse of the tech stuff I'm working on:

- Main Quest:
  - I’m continuing to develop firmware for the new Datecs BlueCash-5000 with its ARM chip.
  - I’m deepening my knowledge of advanced C topics and ARM Cortex-M architecture.
- Side Quest:
  - I’m continuing to work on complex, real-world projects using C++.
  - I’m expanding my knowledge of advanced C++ topics and networking protocols.
- Ask me about:<br>
C++, Neovim, touch typing, keyboards, music production, audio engineering and a bunch of other things.
